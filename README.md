# html_scraping
In this project, we were tasked with scarping a web page that contains mars data. We used the html code to navigate through the page and scrape the table.  By creating a beautiful soup object we are able to parse the html code using python syntax. For part 1 it was important to understand for loops and how we can utililze them to solve problems.
Part 2 was a bit more involved. Essentially started the same way, then we turned the table into a pandas dataframe. From there is is easy to navigate through the tables and answer the questions that were asked. By using the Pandas functions we learned in module 5, such as sortby, groupby, and mean, I was able to accomplish the task. You will find plots for average temp, average pressure, both sorted by month.  Finally you will see the number of terrestrial days by the pressure. By viewing a complete cycle of pressure we can estimate how long it takes Mars to get around the sun. Roughly 700 days, although my graph is not displaying the days on the xaxis.
